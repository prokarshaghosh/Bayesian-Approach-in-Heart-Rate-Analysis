# Bayesian-Approach-in-Heart-Rate-Analysis

The dataset comprises detailed medical profiles of female individuals aged between 45 and 70, living in both rural and urban areas. It provides comprehensive insights into their health status, including prevalent conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Many individuals have experienced cardiovascular events like acute myocardial infarction (M.I) or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), often presenting symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. The data also includes information on medical procedures such as thrombolysis, alongside extensive blood test results revealing variations in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood cell counts. These insights are crucial for understanding the impact of demographic factors, lifestyle choices, and underlying health conditions on cardiovascular health outcomes in this specific demographic group of women.

This dataset appears to contain medical information about individuals, likely related to cardiovascular health and associated conditions. Here's a summary of the columns and some initial observations:

    Family.History: Family history of cardiovascular diseases.
    Diabetes: Presence of diabetes.
    HTN: Hypertension (high blood pressure).
    Allergies: Presence of allergies.
    BP: Blood pressure readings.
    Thrombolysis: Whether thrombolysis (clot-dissolving therapy) was performed.
    BGR, B.Urea, S.Cr, S.Sodium, S.Potassium, S.Chloride, C.P.K, CK.MB, ESR, WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, P.C.V, M.C.V, M.C.H, M.C.H.C, PLATELET_COUNT, NEUTROPHIL, LYMPHO, MONOCYTE, EOSINO, Others: Various blood test results and medical parameters.

    Hypersensitivity: Presence of hypersensitivity reactions.
    cp, trestbps, chol, fbs, restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal, num: More specific medical data including chest pain type, blood pressure measurements, cholesterol levels, etc.
    SK, SK.React, Reaction, Mortality, Follow.Up: Additional medical outcomes or follow-up details.

Observations:

    The dataset primarily focuses on female individuals.
    The age ranges from 45 to 61-70.
    There are variations in lifestyle, health conditions (like diabetes, hypertension), and symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath).
    Some individuals have undergone thrombolysis or have a history of cardiovascular events.
    Blood test results indicate variations in parameters like cholesterol levels, blood counts, and electrolyte levels.
